    <h2>FILM</h2>
    <P>A film, also called a movie, motion picture or moving picture, is a work of visual art used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images.</P>
    <P>These images are generally accompanied by sound, and more rarely, other sensory stimulations.</P>
    <P>The word "cinema", short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art form that is the result of it.</P>
